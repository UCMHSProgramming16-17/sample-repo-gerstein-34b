Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water
Jack and Jill found a monster at the top of the hill
Jack and Jill fought off the monster.
The whole town loves Jack and Jill for saving them from the monster.

The town hired a sculptor to make a statue of Jack and Jill.
The statue is impressive. Unlike my creative writing skills.

THE END
